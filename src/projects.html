            <p>This was my first non-university-coursework script that I made to familiarize/challenge myself with standard programming software and tools, such as Visual Studio Code and git. I wanted to create something that I would use and to explore working with media files. This led me to develop a download video/audio download tool using pytube and youtube-dl, and then have ffmpeg be responsible for handling encoding of the downloaded files.</p>

            <p>A passion project of my friend Kathryn Upson-Smith, it is an ascii based roguelike written in java. I’m personally fascinated with game development, and the opportunity to get experience working on a relative massive codebase in a safe environment while hanging out with a friend of mine was an opportunity I could not pass. Regarding my work on the project, I it can be boiled down to game design, cleanup/code review, and development in java. It has also been a great experience learning to use git as a collaborative tool.</p>

            <p>Regarding my previous statement of wanting to make something I would use, it still stands. I would say I am slightly proud of the fact that I am from Norway, so there is something in me that wants me to use a Norwegian based domain vendor. So, it was fun to discover their API while I was looking for DDNS services from them, which their API supplied. It was great to get experience with bash shell scripting and regex while working on this project.</p>

            <p>The place you currently are, I had to prior experience with HTML and CSS, so it was fun to work with something that gave pretty much instant visual feedback. When you are reading this there is probably a lot of lorum ipsum left on the page, I kind of despise writing about myself. </p>
